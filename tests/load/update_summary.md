I've completed all improvements identified in the code review and fixed the test issues:

1. Error Handling:
- Added specific database exceptions hierarchy
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Fixed tests to properly validate error cases

2. Performance:
- Implemented connection pooling with proper PRAGMA settings
- Made batch size configurable through settings
- Added connection timeout handling

3. Security:
- Added database constraints matching model validation
- Enhanced geometry validation
- Ensured proper parameter binding

4. Documentation:
- Enhanced docstrings and inline comments
- Added comprehensive validation reporting
- Updated tests with proper assertions

The load module now provides robust database operations with improved reliability and maintainability, while maintaining proper validation both at the model and database levels.

### UPDATE 1 ###

All test issues have been resolved. The load module now features:
- Simplified database connection management
- Proper batch size validation
- Complete database constraints and triggers for data validation
- Improved test coverage at 77%

### UDATE 2 ###

I have completed the restructuring of the load module to improve modularity and maintainability. The changes include:

1. Split into Focused Modules:
- connection.py: Enhanced connection pooling and lifecycle management
- schema.py: Schema creation and management with spatial support
- operations.py: Data insertion with batch processing
- reporting.py: Comprehensive validation and statistics
- __init__.py: Clean public API

2. Key Improvements:
- Better separation of concerns with each module having a single responsibility
- Enhanced error handling with specific exceptions
- Improved type safety with proper annotations
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code organization
- Clear module boundaries for better testing and maintenance

3. Features Preserved:
- Spatialite integration
- Batch processing
- Comprehensive validation
- Detailed reporting
- Connection pooling
- Error handling

The load module now provides a more maintainable and extensible codebase while retaining all its original capabilities. The public API remains unchanged, ensuring backward compatibility while providing a cleaner internal structure.

### UPDATE 3 ###

I've fixed the typing issues in the load module:

1. Removed unnecessary type ignores by using proper imports:
   - Changed `from tqdm import tqdm  # type: ignore` to `from tqdm.auto import tqdm`
   - This provides proper type hints for the tqdm library

2. Fixed tuple casting issues in reporting.py:
   - Updated the spatial coverage method to use proper tuple literal syntax
   - Improved type safety for database query results

3. Note: The remaining warning about pysqlite3 missing stubs is expected behavior since it's a third-party library without type hints. This doesn't affect the functionality of the code.

The load module now has improved type safety while maintaining all its functionality.
