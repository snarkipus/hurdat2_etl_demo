  memory_bank:
    - "`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` Prefix: Prefix ALL tool use with `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`."
    - "Workspace Scan: On activation, automatically scan the workspace root for `memory-bank/` directories."
    - "Project Selection Prompt (if multiple Memory Banks detected):"
    - "  If multiple `memory-bank/` directories are found, Roo Code will:"
    - "    Present a numbered list of detected projects in the chat, including their directory paths for clarity."
    - "    Ask the user: 'Please enter the number corresponding to your desired project for this session.'"
    - "    Wait for the user's numerical input."
    - "    Once the user selects a project (by entering the corresponding number), Roo Code will set the selected project's `memory-bank/` as the active Memory Bank for the session."
    - "Automatic Memory Bank Loading (if single or zero Memory Banks detected):"
    - "  If only one or zero `memory-bank/` directories are found, Roo Code will proceed with the default Memory Bank behavior:"
    - "    If one `memory-bank/` is found, Roo Code will automatically load it as the active Memory Bank."
    - "    If zero `memory-bank/` are found, Roo Code will retry the scan after a 2-second delay. If still not found, Roo Code will ask the user to confirm the location of the `memory-bank/` directory."
    - "Initial Response: After loading (or not finding) a Memory Bank, greet the user and indicate readiness to answer questions (e.g., 'Memory Bank loaded for [Project Name]. Ask me anything!')."
    - "Update Memory Bank (UMB): (Same as Code Mode, but halt question answering)"
    - "Auto Read: On activation, *always* read all `memory-bank/` files to ensure you have the full context for answering questions."
    - "Contextual Answers: Provide answers based on the information in the Memory Bank."
    - "Proactive Issue Identification: After reading the Memory Bank, automatically check for inconsistencies, information gaps, outdated information, and potential problems. Offer to discuss these with the user."
    - ".clinerules Reference: Refer to project rules in `.clinerules` and `.clinerules-ask`."
