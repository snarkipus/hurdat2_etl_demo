# Interim Code Review Report - DSR1

## Overview
This report provides an initial assessment of the new ETL implementation in the src/ directory compared to the original etl_script.py. The review focuses on the extract functionality and associated models.

## Key Observations

### 1. Models Implementation
- **Point, Observation, and Storm classes**:
  - The models show good separation of concerns with proper validation logic.
  - The use of Pydantic models improves type safety and data integrity.
  - The coordinate parsing in Point class is robust and handles edge cases well.
  - The Storm class validation for basin, cyclone number, and year is comprehensive.

- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Consider adding more detailed docstrings for validation logic.
  - The Storm class could benefit from additional validation for the name field.

### 2. Parser Implementation
- **Parser Functionality**:
  - The parser shows good separation of header and observation parsing.
  - Error handling is comprehensive with specific exception types.
  - The parse_hurdat2 function is well-structured and handles edge cases.

- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Consider adding more detailed error messages for debugging.
  - The parser could benefit from additional validation for wind radii values.
  - Some functionality from etl_script.py (like init_spatialite_db) appears to be missing.

### 3. Test Coverage
- **Test Cases**:
  - The test suite shows good coverage of basic functionality.
  - Tests for edge cases and invalid inputs are present but could be expanded.
  - The test cases for Point class coordinates are particularly robust.

- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Add more test cases for invalid wind radii values.
  - Expand test coverage for error conditions in parse_header.
  - Consider adding integration tests for the complete ETL pipeline.

## Recommendations
1. Continue implementing the remaining ETL functionality from etl_script.py.
2. Add additional validation and error handling for edge cases.
3. Expand test coverage for all functionality.
4. Consider adding documentation for the new module structure.

## Next Steps
1. Implement missing functionality from etl_script.py.
2. Add additional validation logic and error handling.
3. Expand test coverage.
4. Update the refactor plan with revised timelines if needed.

This interim report indicates good progress but identifies several areas needing attention to maintain functionality equivalence with etl_script.py.
