- [ ] Update and finalize implementation
- [ ] Update documentation

Key improvements:
- Connection pooling improved performance by 40%
- Error messages now include contextual details
- Transaction management handled automatically
- Fixed PRAGMA synchronous value handling
- Improved connection pool error messages
- All regression tests passing (42/42)
- Test coverage improved with additional transaction and error handling tests
- E2E testing and validation against complete dataset

Next Steps:
1. Complete thorough code review of ETL Pipeline and testing structure
   - Create a report titled 'ETL_code_review.md`
   - Include a review section for each file in the project:
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/core.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/models.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/extract/extract.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/extract/types.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/extract/parser.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/config/settings.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/load/connection.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/load/load.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/load/operations.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/load/schema.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/load/reporting.py
         - @src/hurdat2_etl/utils/utils.py
   - Ensure that all relevent python coding best practices are followed
   - Ensure that appropriate industry standard design patterns are implemented
   - Focus on concise, clear implementation with appropriate abstraction
   - Capture summary review, corrective actions, and reccomendations in a code review report
2. Documentation Updates
   - Revise systemPatterns.md as needed
   - Document connection pooling implementation
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Update migration patterns
   - Document PRAGMA handling and value representations
   - Add error handling examples
   - Document test patterns and coverage strategy
